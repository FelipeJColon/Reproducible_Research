## 1. Introduction to Reproducible Research


## Introduction 
- The ultimate goal for scientific evidence is ***replication***
       - Independent people conducting independent studies with different data, 
       methods, and laboratories, to see if they get the same result as someone
       else (Peng, 2016)
- The problem is that replication may not always be possible
       - Studies are getting larger 
       - Big studies demand a lot of money which may not be available
       - A study design may require following individuals for long period of 
       time (e.g. 5-20 years)
       - Some studies are just unique (e.g. the Fukushima incident or the 
       Sverdlovsk anthrax leak)
- The worst standard would be to ***do nothing***  


## Reproducibility
- Bridges the gap between replicability and doing nothing
- Make data, and code available to others so they can verify your analyses
and, if possible, validate your results
- According to Peng (2016) Reproducibility requires:
       - All data an metadata ***made available***
       - Fully specified and ***readable code*** that allows scrutinizing the 
       computer programs used
       - Detailed description of the ***steps followed*** in the data analysis


## Reproducibility from scratch
- Often we start thinking about making our work reproducible late
       - when a journal editor asks for the data and code for peer-review 
       or publication, or
       - when other researchers ask if they can get your data to reproduce your 
       findings  

## Reproducibility from scratch
- By then, **_you may already have multiple versions_** of the dataset and the
methods in your computer (or even multiple computers!)  
- Going through all files to accurately recreate what has been done could be 
a real pain  
- Focusing on reproducibility from the beginning may help you avoid these 
problems 


## Reproducibility - advantages
- Reproducible research reduces the amount of time other people have to 
spend gathering data or developing procedures that are already available for
analysis
<br>
- Making a project reproducible from scratch usually forces people to use 
**_better work habits_**
       - Your code should make it easy for independent researchers to reproduce 
       your findings
       - If your code is too cryptic it will be hard to tell if there are any 
       errors in the analysis  

## Reproducibility - advantages
- Designing your research to be reproducible makes it much easier to change 
things at a later stage (irrespectively of whether changes are due to a journal 
reviewersâ€™ comments or you discover a better dataset or method) 
<br>
- Reproducible research is more likely to be useful to other researchers than 
non-reproducible research


## Some Tips for Reproducibility
- A few tips may allow you organize your research process 
       - Document everything! (really, everything)
       - Use human readable formatting 
       - Tie all your files together


## Document everything!
- Reviewers and other researchers should be able to **_exactly reproduce_** your 
analyses from raw data to final results
- Instructions should be made explicit
       - A **_code book_** detailing information about the variables in the
       set, the methodological choices you  made, the experimental or 
       analytical design, and the file versions used in the final report is 
       very useful
       - You may need to amend or re-write a paper or chapter  
<br>
- Documenting basic things such as documenting your  ***R session*** 
information and the ***operating system*** you used the software on prevent 
your code to crash in another computer
       - small changes in package versions or across OS that may result in 
       different results (e.g. random number seeds)  


## Text files
- Store your documentation in ***text files*** which are easy to manipulate by a
range of programmes and are easy to version
       - `.R` files are text files and can be produced in any text editor!  
<br>
- Documentation should be in a ***human readable*** format 
       - Add comments to your code to communicate its design and purpose  

## Text files
- For important pieces of code use ***literate programming*** (i.e. the code and
the presentational text describing its purpose and design are in the same 
document)  
<br>
- Format your code using a ***style guide***


## Literate programming - example
- Literate programming requires:
    - A documentation language (human readable, e.g. `markdown`)
    - A programming language (machine readable, e.g. `R`)

<br>
![](lit_prog.png)


## Coding standards
- You could use 
[Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) style guide to get started
<br>
- You do not need to follow a particular guide, but having some code standards 
may help your code be easier to read
       - e.g. set the maximum line length to 80 characters
       - Indent your code! minimum 4 spaces
       - do not place spaces around code in brackets  
       - assign objects using `<-` and not `=` or `->`


## Code style
Which one is easier to go through?

```r
# Version 1
plot(x    = dat.supp,
     y    = len.mm,
     ylim = ylim,
     xlab = "date",
     ylab = metric,
     main = (paste0(metric, " for 3 samples ")))

# Version 2
plot(x=dat.supp,y=len.mm,ylim=ylim,xlab="date",ylab=metric,main=(
paste0(metric," for 3 samples ")))
```


## Code style

```r
# Assign to objects and spacing
> x <- rnorm(100)  

> x = rnorm( 100 )   

> 23 -> maxValue  

# Use prefixes for tied files
> 0-download.R
> 1-parse.R
> 2-explore.R
```

## Code style
- Whenever possible, **_avoid using names of existing functions and variables_**
- Give sensible names to variables and functions
<br>

```r
> T <- FALSE

> c <- 10

> mean <- function(x) sum(x)
```


## Tie Your Files Together
- Usually, research projects include a range of individual files that have a 
relationship with each other  
<br>
- Often these relationships between files are not documented 
<br>
- Tie commands (such as `source()` and `read.table()`) are the most efficient 
way to explicitly link your files (we'll discuss them later)  
<br>
- Files need to be accessible and organized so that others can easily understand
what files were used in your analysis, and how they fit together  


## Reproducible Documents
- Document your analysis **as you go**
- Relying on your memory may come back to bite you
- Tools like `Markdown`, `R Markdown`, `knitr` and `RStudio` are extremely 
useful to document your analyses as you do them
- You can preserve the `R` code as well as any kind of a written summary of your analysis in a single document using these tools
- We will cover how to use these tools in the following sections


## 2. Markdown  


## What is Markdown?  

> _"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows
you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then 
convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)."_

<br>
<div class="centered">
John Gruber, creator of Markdown
</div>

## Markdown
- Essentially, `Markdown` is just a way to write web content
- It is written in **_plain text_** allowing you to focus on writing as opposed 
to formatting
- There are some simple (and minimal) formatting elements that are easy to get
used to, so the learning curve is really gentle
- Formatting text in Markdown is **_extremely simple_**
       - All you have control of is things like italicising, making fonts bold, 
       creating headers, and organizing lists


## Markdown Syntax
- Please go to the Dillinger site http://dillinger.io where you will find a 
very useful GUI to learn the basics of the Markdown syntax

![](dillinger2.png)


## Markdown syntax - Italics and Bold
- To _italicise_ a word, surround it with underscores  
- To make words or phrases **bold** surrond them with two asterisks
- You can have _words in italics_ and **in bold font** in the same line!
- Or even **_in italicised bold font_** if you want to
<br>  

```markdown
$ To _italicise_ a word, surround it with underscores

$ To make words or phrases **bold** surrond them with two asterisks

$ You can have _words in italics_ and **in bold font** 
on the same line!

$ Or even **_in italicised bold font_** if you want to
```


## Markdown Syntax - Headers
- There are six types of headers in Markdown:

```markdown
$ # Header 1
$ ## Header 2
$ ### Header 3
$ #### Header 4
$ ##### Header 5
$ ###### Header 6
```


## Markdown Syntax - Links
- There are two different link types in Markdown
- The first link style is called **_inline link_**
       - To create one, wrap the link text in squared brackets, and then wrap
       the link in brackets  
       
       - e.g. [Visit GitHub!](http://www.github.com)

```markdown
$ [Visit GitHub!](http://www.github.com)
```


## Markdown Syntax - Links
- The second link type is called a **_reference link_**
- Here, the link is a reference to another object in the document
- An advantage of the reference links is that multiple links to the same place 
only need to be updated once

## Markdown Syntax - Links
Here's [a link to Github][github], and here's
[a link to Google][google].
And now, here's a link back to [the first link][github].  

[github]: http://www.github.com
[google]: http://www.google.com


```markdown
$ Here's [a link to Github][github], and here's 
$ [a link to Google][google].
$ And now, here's a link back to [the first link][github].  

$ [github]: www.github.com
$ [google]: www.google.com

```

## Markdown Syntax - Images
- To add images to a markdown document, the syntax is very similar to that for
a link
- The difference is that an image is preceded by an exclamation mark
- Images also have two styles, just like links
```markdown
$ ![](http://gadgetsin.com/uploads/2010/10/
                    D_is_for_Darth_by_joewight.jpg)

## Markdown Syntax - Block Quotes
- To create a block quote, preface a line with the "greater than" character

```markdown
> "In a few moments he was barefoot, his stockings folded in 
> his pockets and his canvas shoes dangling by their knotted 
> laces over his shoulders and, picking a pointed salt-eaten 
> stick out of the jetsam among the rocks, he clambered down
> the slope of the breakwater."
```


## Markdown Syntax - Newlines
- Newlines require a double space after the end of a line (varies
between OS and `markdown` versions)

```markdown
First line
Second line
```
<br>
First line
Second line

```markdown
First line
Second line
```
<br>
First line  
Second line



## Markdown Syntax - Unordered Lists
- To create an unordered list, preface each item with an asterisk or a dash
- To add more levels indent the asterisk/dash **_four spaces_** more than the
preceding item
- You could add sub-lists indefinitely, but it may be a good idea to stop after 
three levels

```markdown
- first item 
- second item
* third item 
    - second level  
        - third level
```



## Markdown Syntax - Ordered Lists
- An ordered list is prefaced with numbers, instead of asterisks
- Notice that Markdown and R Markdown will assign the correct list number in
case of an error

```markdown
1. first item  
3. second item  
5. third item   
4. fourth item  
    a. second level
        - third level
```


## Markdown Syntax - Lists
- You can add _italics_, **bold**, or [links](http://google.com) to any of your lists
- Notice that you **_must_** leave a blank line between text and lists

```markdown
Mosquito-borne disease vectors:  

- Malaria (_Anopheles gambiae_)  
- Dengue (_Aedes aegypti_)  
- Zika (_Aedes albopictus_)
```
<br>
Mosquito-borne disease vectors:  

- Malaria (_Anopheles gambiae_)  
- Dengue (_Aedes aegypti_)  
- Zika (_Aedes albopictus_)


## Markdown Syntax - Equations
- You can build equations in Markdown exactly as you would in `LaTeX`

```markdown
# Subscripts and superscripts
$$X_{i}$$ 
$$X_{i,j}$$
$$X^{e}$$
```
<br>
$$X_{i}$$
$$X_{i,j}$$
$$X^{e}$$

## Markdown Syntax - Equations

```markdown
# Subscripts and superscripts on the same argument
$$X^2_{i,j}$$

# Sqrt
$$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$

# Fraction
$$\frac{4z^3}{16}$$
```
<br>
$$X^2_{i,j}$$
$$\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$$
$$\frac{4z^3}{16}$$


## Markdown Syntax - Equations

```markdown
# Summation expressions
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} X^3_i$$

# Self-sizing brackets
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{X_i}{Y_i} \right)$$
```
<br>
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} X^3_i$$
<br>
$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{X_i}{Y_i} \right)$$  


## Markdown Syntax - Equations

```markdown
# Greek letters and special characters
$$\alpha, \sigma, \beta, \delta, \Delta, \gamma, \Gamma$$

$$a \pm b$$
$$x \ge 15$$
$$a_i \ge 0~~~\forall i$$ # Tilde here allocates blanks
```
<br>
$$\alpha,  \sigma, \beta, \delta, \Delta, \gamma, \Gamma$$
$$a \pm b$$
$$x \ge 15$$
$$a_i \ge 0~~~\forall i$$


## Markdown Syntax - Equations

```markdown
# Special functions
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x~dx$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = - y(\gamma - \delta  x)$$

$$g(\mu_{it}) = \alpha + log(d_{it}) + 
                         t' + \beta(e_{it}) + w_{it}$$
```
<br>
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \sin x~dx$$  

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = - y(\gamma - \delta  x)$$

$$g(\mu_{it}) = \alpha + log(d_{it}) + 
t' + \beta(e_{it}) + w_{it}$$


## Markdown Syntax - Equations

```markdown
# Matrices (for some reason they don't work on Dillinger)
$$\mathbf{X} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\right]
$$
```
<br>
$$\mathbf{X} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\right]
$$


## Markdown Syntax - DIY
- Using the text in the box below, make the word "this" italicised and bold, 
and have it linked to www.bbc.co.uk using an inline link

```markdown
You're really, really going to want to see this!
```  
<br>
- Make the following text a **_heading four_**, and turn the phrase _"the BBC"_
into a link to www.bbc.com/news using a reference

```markdown
The Latest News from the BBC are here!
```


## Markdown Syntax - DIY
- Try to produce a list similar to the one below

![](list.png)


## 3. R Markdown


## R markdown
- Integrates **_R code_** with **_Markdown_**
- Documents written in R Markdown have **_live_** R coded nested within them 
- The results from the embeded R code are inserted into the Markdown document 
- R markdown files can be converted to standard Markdown using the `knitr`
package
- Subsequently, the Markdown file can be converted into HTML with `markdown` 
package
- The final output may be an HTML page, a PDF document or a DOC file depending
on your computer configuration
- Here, we will **_only_** produce HTML files 


## Your First R Markdown Document
- To create a new Markdown document, click on the menu in the upper left hand 
side on **_Rstudio_**

![](rmarkdown.png)


## Your First R Markdown Document
- RStudio will prompt you with a dialog box to set some metadata for the
document
- Feel free to either fill it out now or just click _OK_
- You can **_always_** make changes to this information later

![](metadata.png)


## Your First R Markdown Document
- RStudio creates a new R Markdown document with some example text
- Take a look at it to get an idea of how R Markdown documents are written

![](start.png)


## Your First R Markdown Document
- When you are ready to process and view your document, click on the **_Knit
HTML_** button on the top of the editor window

![](knit.png)


## Your First R Markdown Document
- If you are not using R Studio, type the following on the console:

```r
> library(knitr) 
> knit2html("document.Rmd") 
> browseURL("document.html")
```
## Got an error?

- If `knit2html()` gives you the following error

```markdown
Error in knit2html("document.Rmd") : 
  It seems you should call rmarkdown::render() instead 
  of knitr::knit2html()  because document.Rmd appears 
  to be an R Markdown v2 document.
```
<br>
then you will need to use `rmarkdown::render("document.Rmd")` 
instead  


## Your First R Markdown Document
- Your output should look more or less like the figure below
- Notice some code is printed

![width](output.png)


## Your First R Markdown Document
- By default, `markdown` or `knitr` will create just an HTML file
- If you want to also create the corresponding Markdown (`.md`) file, you 
need to change the settings
_ In the end, you should have three documents (`.Rmd`, `.html` and `.md`)

![width](keepmd.png)


## Customizing your document
- You should have noticed that R code chunks begin with 

```r
$ ```{r}
```
<br>
and end with just 
<br>
```r
$ ```
```
<br>
- Any R code that you want R to evaluate **_must_** be contained within these 
delimiters, unless you have **_inline code_** (more on this later)


## Customizing your document
- Code chunks have labels which are used when a code chunk creates a plot or
the output is cached for future use. If you don't give the chunk a label, R will
assign one to it (e.g. `unnamed-chunk-1`)
- By default, all code and comments in a chunk are printed out to the document, 
- If you choose **_NOT to_** print the R code in the resulting document, you 
need to add `echo=FALSE` to the chunk-level arguments
- 

```markdown
# Note that all labels and code chunk options must be on 
# the same line and separated by commas

$ ```{r chunkLabel, echo=FALSE}
$ summary(cars)
$ ```
```

## Customizing your document
- You can hide your results with `results='hide'`
- This is very handy when you do not want to show all the computations that
lead to the creation of a plot or table, or when you aim to use a result for
an **_inline_** computation

```{r mytime, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
# ```{r mytime, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
time <- Sys.time()
x    <- rnorm(100, mean=20, sd=2)
mu   <- mean(x)
# ```

# Today is **`r time`** and the balance in my current
#  account is just **`r round(mu, digits = 2)`** pounds!
```

Today is **`r time`** and the balance in my current account is 
just **`r round(mu, digits = 2)`** pounds!

## Customizing your document
- You may have noticed that R will evaluate a code line and put the results
immediately after it
- You can also push all results to the end of a chunk with `results='hold'`

```r
$```{r}
$ 2 + 2
$ 3 + 3
$ 4 + 4
$```

$```{r, results="hold"}
$ 2 + 2
$ 3 + 3
$ 4 + 4
$```
```

## Customizing your document
- You may decide **_NOT_** to evaluate a code chunk, or to evaluate particular 
parts of it
- To do so, add the `eval=FALSE` or an `eval=c(2,3)` like argument 
to the chunk options

```r
$```{r, eval=FALSE}
$ 2 + 2
$ 3 + 3
$ 4 + 4
$```

$```{r, results="hold", eval=c(1, 3)}
$ 2 + 2
$ 3 + 3
$ 4 + 4
$```
```


## Customize graphics
- You have seen that you can generate and display plots in the document
- You can change the height, width, alignment and several other options
by modifying the chunk-level arguments

![](height.png)


## Add Tables
- Tables can be **_extremely non-reproducible_** if generated by hand
- Tables can be easily generated in a reproducible manner with the `xtable` 
package which takes tabular information and formats it in either HTML or LaTeX
formats
- In the chunk options, you should specify `results="asis"` otherwise 
your table will not be displayed correctly

![](xtable.png)


## Setting Global Options
- Sometimes you may want to set an option that applies to **_all chunks_**
- This can be done modifying the `opts_chunk` variable in `knitr` 
- You do that by creating a code chunk somewhere in the beginning of the 
document and modifying the `opts_chunk` object (see `?opts_chunk`)
- For example, we can modify the default so that all chunks **_do not print_** 
the R code and **_always_** hide the results
- To know more about the different chunk options visit the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options) or [R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) pages


## Setting Global Options

<br>
![](global.png)


## Caching computations
- Each time you want to view your document in the formatted version, you need 
to **re-compile**
     - If your code chunks are quick and not too many, this is **_typically 
     not a problem_**
     - Otherwise, it can be a **_real pain_** having to wait for the file to 
     compile each time you modify it
- By setting `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options, the chunk runs once, and stores the output in a database in your `wd`

## Caching computations
- When you re-compile the `knitr` re-loads the stored output from the database 
- If the code in the chunk changes at all, `knitr` re-run the code
- `Warning!` Dependencies between chunks **_are not checked_**, and so if the 
results of a cached chunk depend on a previous modified chunk that has been 
modified, those changes **_may not propogate_** to later cached chunks


## 4. File Management


## Directories
- Windows, Linux and Mac OS organize files in a hierarchical manner with 
directories located inside of other directories
     - A **_root directory_** is the first level in a disk (the root out of 
     which the file tree grows)
     - All other directories are **_sub-directories_**
- In Windows, `C:\` is a root directory
- In Unix systems, the root directory is denoted by a forward slash (`/`)
- The paths to directories in R must be given in quotes


## Setting Directory Paths - Windows
- The **_path_** to subdirectories in Windows is typically of the form
       - `"C:\Documents\Data\ReprResearch"`
       
- In R, the backward slash is used to denote several things (e.g. `\t` indicates
a tab and `\n` is a new line)
- Thus, you need to use two backslashes instead of one
       - `"C:\\Documents\\Data\\ReprResearch"`

- Alternatively, you can use single forward slashes  
       - `"C:/Documents/Data/ReprResearch"`


## Setting Directory Paths - Unix
- The **_path_** to subdirectories in Unix systems is of the form
       - `"/home/user/directory"` (*absolute path*) or 
       - `"~/directory"`  (*relative path*)  


## File and Directory Name Conventions
- It is good practice to **_avoid putting spaces_** in file and directory names
- **_Spaces are (very) problematic_** when R tries to read a file path because 
it believes that the space indicates that the path name has ended
- Multi-word names can be made readable by adopting a convention such as [CamelBack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase)
       - e.g. use `ExampleProject` instead of `Example Project`


## Create a README file
- It is good practice to create a README file for each project
- This file should give an overview of all the files in the project and briefly 
describe the project including things such as:
       - _Authors and contact information_ 
       - _Input file configuration instructions_
       - _Special packages installation instructions_
       - _Operating instructions_
       - _A list of files included_
       - _Copyright and licensing information_
       - _Known bugs_
       - _Troubleshooting_
       - _Credits and acknowledgments_
       - _Updates_


## File Management Commands
- R has a wide range of commands for files management
       - `getwd()` and `setwd()`
       - `dir()` and `list.files()`
       - `dir.create()` and `unlink()`  **# Be really careful with unlink()**
       - `file.path()` and `file.exists()`
       - `file.edit()`, `file.copy()` and `file.rename()`
       - `source()`

## File Management Commands
```r
# Create folder if !exist
if(!file.exists("newFolder")){ 
    dir.create("newFolder")
 }

# Create empty file
file.create(file.path("newFolder", "newFile.R")) 

# Edit file 
file.edit(file.path("newFolder", "newFile.R"))   

# Delete folder and contents
unlink("newFolder", recursive=TRUE)              
```


## 5. Dynamically Importing Data


## Downloading Data
- You can always **_download data by hand_**, but then you will need to provide 
fully documented instructions to achieve reproducibility
- You can dynamically download data using `download.file()` 
- Important parameters are `url`, `destfile` and `method`
- If the url starts with **_https_** and you are working on **_Unix_** you 
need to specify `method="curl"` (not required under Windows)
- Once a file is downloaded, you can use `read.table`, `read.csv` or `fread()`
- Notice that **_data may change in the near future_**
       - Thus, it is important you record the date when you accessed the file


## Example: UK Traffic Counts
Let's download UK Road Traffic Count data from the 
[UK Gov Data Site](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/gb-road-traffic-counts)

![](data.png)


## Download the data

```r
# Assign URL to object
> url1 <- "http://data.dft.gov.uk/gb-traffic-matrix/"
> url2 <- "Traffic-major-roads-km.csv"
> fileUrl <- paste0(url1, url2)

# Download file
> download.file(url=fileUrl, destfile="traffic.csv", method="curl")


> list.files() # Verify download

> data <- read.csv("traffic.csv") # Read data 

> head(data[1:2,1:7]) # Explore some rows/columns

> dateAccessed <- date() # Get date of access 
```


## Reading Data
- You may want to read a file directly from the web **_without downloading it_**
into your computer 
       - perhaps you need to _clean_ the set first
- This is possible using a so called **_file connection_**
- `url()` creates a connection to the web server to allow you read data directly 
from it
- The `open="r"` argument opens a connection on **_read mode only_**
- `close()` closes the connection with the server


## Reading Data

<br>
```r
> con <- 
url("http://data.dft.gov.uk/gb-traffic-matrix/Traffic-major-roads-km.csv",
            open="r")

> traffic <- read.csv(con)

> head(traffic[1:3,1:7])

## Reading Large Tabular Sets
- You can read large tabular datasets with `fread()` from the `data.table`
package
- `fread()` is typically more efficient than `read.table()` which is great when 
using big sets (some issues with online connections though)
- Much faster at subsetting, group, and updating than `data.frame()`
- Here **_we will not cover_** the whole functionality of the package but I
encourage you to learn about it


## Fast Reading

```{r fast,cache=TRUE,message=FALSE}
require(data.table)
bigData <- data.frame(x=rnorm(1e6), y=rnorm(1e6))

tempFile <- tempfile()

write.table(bigData, file=tempFile, row.names=FALSE, col.names=TRUE, 
            sep="\t", quote=FALSE)

system.time(fread(tempFile))
system.time(read.table(tempFile, header=TRUE, sep="\t"))
```


## Dynamically Reading Data with `data.table`
<br>
```{r, cache=TRUE, dependson='fast'}
# Read from DropBox
url1    <- "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/"
url2    <- "15316004/mydata.csv" 
fileUrl <- paste0(url1, url2)

nitrate <- fread(fileUrl)
```


## Compressed Files Stored Online - .zip
- Compressed files are very common for data sharing
- You can both download and decompress files with R in a reproducible 
fashion
```{r, cache=TRUE,dependson='fast'}
zip1    <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/"
zip2    <- "repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
zipFile <- paste0(zip1, zip2)
download.file(zipFile, destfile="activity.zip")

extractData <- unzip("activity.zip")      # Decompress file
tabularData <- fread(extractData)         # Read data

# Alternatively
tabularData2 <- fread(unzip("activity.zip"))
```



## Compressed Files Stored Online - .gz
<br>
```r
url1   <- "http://www.unified-democracy-scores.org/"
url2   <- "files/20110104/uds_summary.csv.gz"
newUrl <- paste0(url1, url2)
temp <- tempfile()                 

download.file(newUrl, temp)           # Download data to temp
udsSumm <- read.csv(gzfile(temp, "uds_summary.csv"))
unlink(temp)

head(udsSumm[,1:5], n=3)

2 United States 1947       2 1.106365 0.2899292 
3 United States 1948       2 1.063506 0.2553244 
```


## Reading Other Data Types
- `twitteR` allows you to download data from Twitter including tweets and 
trending topics
- `WDI` is useful to download data directly from the World Bank's Development 
Indicators database
- The [`rOpenSci`](http://ropensci.org/packages/index.html) group has
several packages for accessing scientific data from online sources including 
academic journals
- `RMySQL` was developed to interact with **_MySQL_** data bases
- `rhdf5` allows the interaction with HDF5 databases


## 6. Version Control


## Version Control
- We constantly create something, save it, change it, then save it again
- Version Control Systems (VCS) manage this process in a reliable and efficient 
manner
- Especially important when collaborating with others
- Primarily designed for software projects where code files are typically 
small text files, but they can also be applied to large data analysis projects

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control)


## Version Control - Git
- Popular version control systems these days are [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 
[Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/), and 
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
- `Git` is the one of the most (_if not the most_) popular VCS today
- Everything can stored in local repositories on your computer and online
- Can be easily operated from the command line or a GUI

[http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git)


## Version Control - GitHub
_ There are many complementary web sites like [GitHub](https://github.com/), 
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
where you can showcase your projects
- Here, I will focus on GitHub it allows you to easily interact with the online
GUI


## GitHub
- `GitHub` is an interface and cloud hosting service built for `Git`
- `Git` does the version control and `GitHub` stores the data remotely 

## GitHub Advantages
- Some of the advantages of `Git` are:
       - **Keeps records** of who contributed what to a project
       - It has a section to **note and discuss issues** with
       collaborators
       - You can **host a wiki for each repository**
       - You can accept or decline other people's contributions (very useful 
       when someone else finds a bug)
       - `Git` will only create a new version of your file **when you
       ask it to**
       - Previous versions of your files are **_stored indefinitely_**
       - If `Git` identifies conflicts between versions, it allows you to
       reconcile them


## Using GitHub
- There are several ways to use `GitHub`:  
       - Using the terminal (Unix) or 
       [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) (Windows)
       - Using the online interface
       - Downloading the GUI (Windows and Mac)
       - Through R Studio
- Here, I will focus on the first two options to get you started


## Setting Up an Account
- To set up and account go the [GitHub web page](https://github.com/)
click on **"Sign up"** and follow the instructions
- **IMPORTANT: If you want to use GitHub with the terminal use the same email 
address that you would use when setting up Git on your computer!**
- You will be then prompted to a page with several options to learn more about
how to use `Git` and `GitHub`

![](github.png)


## Creating a GitHub Repository
- There are two methods for creating a repository
     - Start a repository from scratch
     - "Fork" someone else's repo
- To create a New Repository click on the `create new` icon to create a new 
repository

![](newrepo.png)

## Creating a GitHub Repository
- Select **_Public_** (Private repos require a paid or education account)
- Assign a name to it (e.g. `myFirstRepo`)
- Check the box next to `Initialize this repository with a README`
- Click the **Create repository** button


## Creating a Local Copy - Terminal
- If you work from the terminal, you need to create a copy of this repo on your 
computer so that you can make changes to it
- Open either Git Bash (Windows) or Terminal (Unix)
- Enter the following commands in the console (one at a time) to define user 
name and email (`--list` confirms the changes)

```markdown
$ git config --global user.name "Your User Name Here"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
$ git config --list 
```
- **Make sure there are 2 dashes side-by-side before the word "global"**


## Creating a Local Copy - Terminal
- Now, go to the directory where you would like to store the copy of the repo
- Navigate to this new directory using `cd` ("change directory")
- Initialize a local Git repository in this directory
- Clone the repository 

```markdown
$ cd ~/Documents/GitHub_repos
$ git init
$ git clone https://github.com/your-user-name-goes-here/myFirstRepo.git
```


## Create a New Repository
- Now let's:
     - add a new file
     - modify and re-upload the file
     - see tracked changes
     - fork someone else's repo 


## Adding Changes with the Terminal
- You need to let `Git` know that you want it to track a particular file
     - `git add myfile` adds one file at the time
     - `git add .` or `git add *` add all new files


## Committing
- The next step is called a `commit`
- Here, you specify what changes have been made to the file (briefly)

```markdown
$ git commit -m "your message goes here"`
```
<br>
- The command adds a description (notice the double quotes) of what changes 
were made since the last committed changes 
     - This only updates your local repo, not the remote repo on `GitHub`
- To see a log of **_all the commits_** you've made to a repo, type 
`git log` (exit the log typing `q`)


## Pushing Changes to GitHub
- The next step is to update the remote repo (`GitHub`)
- To do so use 

```markdown
$ git push origin master
```

<br>
- `origin` is your GitHub remote repo  
- `master` is the default name of the branch you are working on


## 7. RPubs


## RPubs
- Is an online platform to publish R markdown documents on the web
- Developed by `RStudio`
- You can do it with `RStudio` with the click of a button! 

![](rstudio.png)


## 8. Reproducibility Checklist


## Don't Do Things By Hand!
- Things done by hand need to be precisely documented (harder than it sounds)
- Manually downloading data from a web site (whenever possible)
- Reformatting data files



## Avoid Pointing And Clicking
- GUIs are convenient but the actions you take with a GUI can be difficult for
others to reproduce
- Some GUIs produce a log file or script which includes equivalent commands that
can be saved for later examination
- Be careful with data analysis software that is highly interactive as it may
lead to non-reproducible analyses


## Teach a Computer!
- If something needs to be done as part of your analysis try to teach your 
computer to do it 
- Teaching a computer almost guarantees reproducibilty
- For example, by hand, you can:

  1. Go to the UCI Machine Learning Repository at
  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
  2. Download the [Bike Sharing
  Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)
  by clicking on the link to the Data Folder, then clicking on the
  link to the zip file of dataset, and choosing "Save Linked File
  As..." and then saving it to a folder on your computer

## Or You can teach your computer to do the same thing!

```r
url1   <- "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/"
url2   <- "machine-learning-databases/00275/"
url3   <- "Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip"
newUrl <- paste0(url1, url2, url3)

download.file(newUrl, destfile="Bike-Sharing-Dataset.zip")
```

- Code can always be executed in R (providing that the link is available)


## Use Some Version Control
- Add changes in small chunks (don't just do one massive commit )

![](vcs.png)


## Document Your Software Environment
- If you work on a complex project involving many tools / datasets,
  the software and computing environment can be critical for
  reproducing your analysis
     - **Computer architecture**: CPU (Intel, AMD, ARM), GPUs, 
     - **Operating system**: Windows, Mac OS, Linux / Unix
     - **Supporting software / infrastructure**: Libraries, R packages,
     dependencies
     - **External dependencies**: Web sites, data repositories, remote
     databases, software repositories
     - **Version numbers**: Ideally, for everything (if available)


## Always Set Your Seed!
- Random number generators generate pseudo-random numbers based on an
  initial seed (usually a number or set of numbers)
- In R you can use the `set.seed()` function to set the seed and to
    specify the random number generator to use
- Setting the seed allows the stream of random numbers to be reproducible
